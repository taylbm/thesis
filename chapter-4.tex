\section{Discussion}
It has been shown that the constrained $Z_{DR}$ datasets aid in determining event biases, which then allows hydrometeor type to be inferred from the unbiased
datasets. Now, statistics are compiled, and the probable source of the bias addressed. The relative merit of the two radar systems in observing lake-effect
snow is also discussed.
\subsection{Diagnosing $Z_{DR}$ Bias}
The source of the bias could be due to large differences in beam volumes between radars, in combination with a large gradients of $Z_{DR}$ with height. A similiar result was found by \citep{Ryzhkov2007a}, in that cross-beam gradients of $Z_{DR}$ can produce significant biases. Modeling the beam as a Gaussian function, Equation \ref{eq:beam_pattern} gives the solid angle of the beam, as a function of beamwidth $\theta$ \citep{Probert1962}. 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:beam_pattern}
\Omega = \int \int f^{2}(\theta) d\omega \approx \frac{\pi \theta^{2}}{8 \ln 2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:beam_volume}
V = \frac{\Omega}{4\pi} * \frac{4}{3} \pi r^{3}
\end{equation}
 Equation \ref{eq:beam_volume} describes how the beam broadens as range ($r$) increases.  This combined with 
 differing $\Omega$ creates the large difference in beam volumes between radars, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:ideal_beam}.

 As to why only certain cases are biased, it is likely due to these cases containing deeper, more intense 
 precipitation, with more opportunity for intra-cloud variations, e.g. ongoing aggregation. As shown in Table \ref{diagnosebias}, biased cases contain precipitating structures that are on average 1.1 km deeper than unbiased 
 cases. Furthermore, biased cases are shown to be more intense, with average $Z_{eH}$ values 2-3 dBZ greater 
 than unbiased cases. 
Another result that supports this is found by comparing the range of $Z_{DR}$ values present in each case. As 
shown in Figure \ref{fig:bias_range}, the biased cases tend towards a larger range of values than unbiased.

\subsection{$Z_{DR}$ Statistics}
A statistical comparison of synoptic and lake-effect cases is made in Table \ref{eventcompare}. Both types of events show very similiar mean values, with both radars indicating 0.2 dB for lake-effect and 0.3 dB for synoptic. This suggests that synoptic events tend more towards pristine snow crystals, while lake-effect events contain more aggregated snow. While the mean values match between radars, it is shown that KBUF yields a larger range of $Z_{DR}$ regardless of the type of event. A wider beamwidth could aid in the detection a larger variety of hydrometeor types.

\subsection{Relative Merits of C-Band vs. S-Band in Lake-Effect Snow}
The results have shown that the wider beamwidth of S-Band may contribute to the detection of a higher diversity of hydrometeors per sampling volume. This
becomes more critical for mixed phases of precipitation, but for pure snow is not as relevant. For quantitative precipitation purposes this becomes more
relevant, as the shape of the snow crystals can give insights into their density, providing a better estimate of snow-to-liquid ratios. Furthermore,
comparing values of $Z_{eH}$ in lake-effect snow events versus synoptic events has shown that C-Band radar has a slight advantage in detecting shallow snow-squalls.
