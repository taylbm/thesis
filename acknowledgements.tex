I would like thank my primary supervisor, Dr. Peter Taylor, for enabling me to pursue my passion for meteorology, and providing insightful critiques to my
work. My co-supervisor and committee member Drs. George Isaac and David Sills played a big role in guiding me through my research, and I greatly thank them for 
their viewpoints. Dr. Diar Hassan was the spark for this research, and I thank him for being a mentor to me. I would also like to thank and acknowledge Sudesh
Boodoo at Environment and Climate Change Canada for providing data from King City research radar, and the NOAA big data project for enabling access to NWS
radar data. Thanks to the NSERC Discovery Grant and The Weather Network for financial support. I couldn't have moved to another country and completed this
research without my wife Liz by my side. She has supported me from day one. I would like to express my love and appreciation for my family, my Mom for giving
me the weather-bug, my Dad for his writing skills, and both for a strong foundation in maths. Thanks to my sisters Lauren and Jenna for coming to visit in
Toronto. I love you all. Finally, my colleagues Zheng Qi Wang and Kaiti Jiang were always there for pints of wisdom.
