% You really should read the documentation for the class file
% (york-thesis.pdf) to see what all of the additional macros and
% booleans do. As well, many of the macros you are used to using
% behave differently in this class.

% You may, of course, remove all comments from your document.

%========== citation setup  =================
\usepackage{natbib} % I use natbib, but you can use
                                % any citation format; the class file
                                % is agnostic about citation styles.            
\bibpunct{(}{)}{;}{a}{}{,}

%========= package setup ================
\setboolean{masters}{true}      % set true for a Master's thesis;
                                % false for a PhD dissertation
\setboolean{hasfigures}{true}  % set true if you have figures

\masterof{Science}           % this is the type of Master's degree you
                          % are attempting. If the boolean masters is
                          % false, this has no effect.

% If you do not have one or more of these commands in your document,
% simply delete the line.

% are going to use them, they have to be defined before you begin your
% document environment.
